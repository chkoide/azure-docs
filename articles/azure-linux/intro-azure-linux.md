# What is the Azure Linux Container Host for AKS? 

The Azure Linux Container Host is an operating system image that is optimized for running container workloads on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../../articles/aks/intro-kubernetes.md). It's maintained by Microsoft and based on Microsoft Azure Linux, an open-source Linux distribution created by Microsoft. The Azure Linux Container Host is lightweight containing only the packages needed to run container workloads, hardened based on significant validation tests and internal usage, and compatible with Azure agents. The Azure Linux Container Host provides reliability and consistency from cloud to edge across AKS, AKS for Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Arc. You can deploy Azure Linux node pools in a new cluster, add Azure Linux node pools to your existing clusters, or migrate your existing nodes to Azure Linux nodes. To learn more about Azure Linux, see the [Azure Linux GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner).

## Azure Linux Container Host key benefits

The Azure Linux Container Host offers the following key benefits: 

- **Secure supply chain**: Microsoft builds, signs, and validates the Azure Linux Container Host packages from source, and hosts its packages and sources in Microsoft-owned and secured platforms. 
- **Small and lightweight**: The Azure Linux Container Host only includes the necessary set of packages needed to run container workloads - as a result, it consumes limited disk and memory resources.
- **Secure by default**: Microsoft builds the Azure Linux Container Host with an emphasis on security and follows the secure-by-default principles, including using a hardened Linux kernel with Azure cloud optimizations and flags tuned for Azure. It also provides a reduced attack surface and eliminates patching and maintenance of unnecessary packages. For more details on Azure Linux Container Host's security principles see [AKS's security concepts](../../articles/aks/concepts-security.md).
- **Extensively validated**: The AKS and Azure Linux teams run a suite of functional and performance regression tests with the Azure Linux Container Host before we release to customers. This enables earlier issue detection and mitigation.â€‹ 

## Limitations 

The Azure Linux Container Host currently has the following limitations:

- The Azure Linux Container Host supports the NCv3 series and NCasT4_v3 series VM sizes. The NC A100 v4 series is currently not supported. 
- The Azure Linux Container Host supports Qualys, Tenable, Trivy, and Microsoft Defender for Containers as vulnerability scanning tools. We'll continue to grow the ecosystem.
- The Azure Linux Container Host supports SELinux via manual configuration. AppArmor is currently not supported.

If there are areas you would like us to prioritize over others, please let us know by filing an issue on the [AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).
