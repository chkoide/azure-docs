# What is Azure Spring Apps?

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Standard consumption (Preview) ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

Azure Spring Apps makes it easy to deploy Spring Boot applications to Azure without any code changes. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring applications so developers can focus on their code. Azure Spring Apps provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.

The following video shows an app composed of Spring Boot applications running on Azure using Azure Spring Apps.

## Why use Azure Spring Apps?

Deployment of applications to Azure Spring Apps has many benefits. You can:

* Efficiently migrate existing Spring apps and manage cloud scaling and costs.
* Modernize apps with Spring Cloud patterns to improve agility and speed of delivery.
* Run Java at cloud scale and drive higher usage without complicated infrastructure.
* Develop and deploy rapidly without containerization dependencies.
* Monitor production workloads efficiently and effortlessly.

Azure Spring Apps supports both Java [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and ASP.NET Core [Steeltoe](https://steeltoe.io/) apps. Steeltoe support is currently offered as a public preview. Public preview offerings let you experiment with new features prior to their official release.

## Service overview

As part of the Azure ecosystem, Azure Spring Apps allows easy binding to other Azure services including storage, databases, monitoring, and more.

* Azure Spring Apps is a fully managed service for Spring Boot apps that lets you focus on building and running apps without the hassle of managing infrastructure.

* Deploy your JARs or code for your Spring Boot app or Zip for your Steeltoe app, and Azure Spring Apps automatically wires your apps with Spring service runtime and built-in app lifecycle.

* Monitoring is simple. After deployment you can monitor app performance, fix errors, and rapidly improve applications.

* Full integration to Azure's ecosystems and services.

* Azure Spring Apps is enterprise ready with fully managed infrastructure, built-in lifecycle management, and ease of monitoring.

### Get started with Azure Spring Apps

The following articles help you get started:

* [Launch your first app](quickstart.md)
* [Introduction to the sample app](quickstart-sample-app-introduction.md)

The following articles help you migrate existing Spring Boot apps to Azure Spring Apps:

* [Migrate Spring Boot applications to Azure Spring Apps](/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-spring-boot-to-azure-spring-apps)
* [Migrate Spring Cloud applications to Azure Spring Apps](/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-spring-cloud-to-azure-spring-apps?pivots=sc-standard-tier)

The following quickstarts apply to the Basic/Standard plan only. For Enterprise quickstarts, see the next section.

* [Provision an Azure Spring Apps service instance](quickstart-provision-service-instance.md)
* [Set up the configuration server](quickstart-setup-config-server.md)
* [Build and deploy apps](quickstart-deploy-apps.md)

## Standard consumption plan

The Standard consumption plan provides a flexible billing model where you pay only for compute time used instead of provisioning resources. Start with as little as 0.25 vCPU and dynamically scale out based on HTTP or events powered by Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA). You can also scale your app instance to zero and stop all charges related to the app when there are no requests to process.

The Standard consumption plan simplifies the virtual network experience for running polyglot apps. When you deploy frontend apps as containers in Azure Container Apps and Spring apps in the Standard consumption plan, all your apps share the same virtual network in the same Azure Container Apps environment. There's no need to create disparate subnets and Network Security Groups for frontend apps, Spring apps, and the Spring service runtime.

## Enterprise plan

The Enterprise plan provides commercially supported Tanzu components with SLA assurance. For more information, see the [SLA for Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/spring-apps). This support helps enterprise customers ship faster for mission-critical workloads with peace of mind. The Enterprise plan helps unlock Spring’s full potential while including feature parity and region parity with the Standard plan.

The following video introduces the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan.

### Deploy and manage Spring and polyglot applications

The fully managed VMware Tanzu® Build Service™ in the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan automates container creation, management and governance at enterprise scale using open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) and commercial [VMware Tanzu® Buildpacks](https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-buildpacks/). Tanzu Build Service offers a higher-level abstraction for building apps. Tanzu Build Service also provides a balance of control that reduces the operational burden on developers and supports enterprise IT operators who manage applications at scale. You can configure what Buildpacks to apply and build Spring applications and polyglot applications that run alongside Spring applications on Azure Spring Apps.

Tanzu Buildpacks makes it easier to build Spring, Java, NodeJS, Python, Go and .NET Core applications and configure application performance monitoring agents such as Application Insights, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics, and Elastic.

### Route client requests to applications

You can manage and discover request routes and APIs exposed by applications using the fully managed Spring Cloud Gateway for VMware Tanzu® and API portal for VMware Tanzu®.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu effectively routes diverse client requests to applications in Azure Spring Apps, Azure, and on-premises. Spring Cloud Gateway also addresses cross-cutting considerations for applications behind the Gateway, such as securing, routing, rate limiting, caching, monitoring, resiliency and hiding applications. You can make the following configurations:

* Single sign-on integration with your preferred identity provider without any extra code or dependencies.
* Dynamic routing rules to applications without any application redeployment.
* Request throttling without any backing services.

API Portal for VMware Tanzu provides API consumers with the ability to find and view API route details exposed by Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu and test API requests.

### Use flexible and configurable VMware Tanzu components

With the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan, you can use fully managed VMware Tanzu components on Azure without operational hassle. You can select which VMware Tanzu components you want to use in your environment, either during or after Enterprise instance creation. The following components are available today:

* [Tanzu Build Service](how-to-enterprise-build-service.md)
* [Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu](how-to-configure-enterprise-spring-cloud-gateway.md)
* [API Portal for VMware Tanzu](how-to-use-enterprise-api-portal.md)
* [Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu®](how-to-enterprise-application-configuration-service.md)

* [Application Live View for VMware Tanzu®](how-to-use-application-live-view.md)
* [Application Accelerator for VMware Tanzu®](how-to-use-accelerator.md)

VMware Tanzu components deliver increased value so you can accomplish the following tasks:

* Grow your enterprise grade application portfolio from a few applications to thousands with end-to-end observability while delegating operational complexity to Microsoft and VMware.
* Lift and shift Spring applications across Azure Spring Apps and any other compute environment.
* Control your build dependencies, deploy polyglot applications, and deploy Spring Cloud middleware components as needed.

### Unlock Spring’s full potential with Long-Term Support (LTS)

The Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan includes VMware Spring Runtime Support for application development and deployments. This support gives you access to Spring experts, enabling you to unlock the full potential of the Spring ecosystem to develop and deploy applications faster.

Typically, open-source Spring project minor releases are supported for a minimum of 12 months from the date of initial release. In the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan, Spring project minor releases receive commercial support for a minimum of 24 months from the date of initial release through the VMware Spring Runtime Support entitlement. This extended support ensures the security and stability of your Spring application portfolio even after the open source end of life dates. For more information, see [Spring Boot support](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support).

### Fully integrate into the Azure and Java ecosystems

Azure Spring Apps, including the Enterprise plan, runs on Azure in a fully managed environment. You get all the benefits of Azure and the Java ecosystem, and the experience is familiar and intuitive, as shown in the following table:
