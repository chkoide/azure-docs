# Testing reachability of Azure Load Balancer frontend IPv4 address with ping

Standard Public Azure Load Balancer with a frontend IPv4 address supports testing reachability using ping. Testing reachability of a load balancer frontend is useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues. In this article, you learn how to use ping for testing a frontend of an existing Standard public load balancer. It can be completed from an Azure Virtual Machine or from a device outside of Azure.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) and access to the Azure portal.

- A standard public load balancer with an IPv4 frontend in your subscription. For more information on creating an Azure Load Balancer, see [Quickstart: Create a public load balancer](/azure/load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-portal) to load balance VMs using the Azure portal.

- An Azure Virtual Machine with a public IP address assigned to its network interface. For more information on creating a virtual machine with a public IP, see [Quickstart: Create a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal).

## Testing from a device outside of Azure

This section describes testing reachability of a standard load balancer frontend from a device outside of Azure with ping. Follow the directions for the operating system that you're using.

### [Windows](#tab/windows-outide/)

1. From your Windows device, open the **Search taskbar** and enter `cmd`. Select **Command Prompt**.
2. In the command prompt, type the following command: 

```dos
    ping <Input your load balancer’s public IPv4 address>
```

3. Review ping's output.

### [Linux](#tab/linux-outside/)

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type the following command:

```bash
    ping <Input your load balancer’s public IPv4 address>
```

3. Review ping's output.

## Testing from an Azure Virtual Machine

This section describes how to test reachability of a standard public load balancer frontend from an Azure Virtual Machine. First, you create an inbound Network Security Group (NSG) rule on the virtual machine to allow ICMP traffic. Then, you ping the frontend of the load balancer from the virtual machine.

### Configure inbound NSG rule

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. In the Search bar at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines** and select Virtual machines.
1. In **Virtual machines**, select your virtual machine from the list.
1. In the virtual machine’s menu, select **Networking** and then select **Add inbound port rule**.

1. In **Add inbound security rule**, enter or select the following information:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Source** | Enter **Any** |
    | **Source port ranges** | Enter **\*** |
    | **Destination** | Enter **Any** |
    | **Service** | Ender **Custom** |
    | **Destination port ranges** | Enter **\*** |
    | **Protocol** | Select **ICMP** |
    | **Action** | Select **Allow** |
    | **Priority** | Enter **100** or a priority of your choosing. |
    | **Name** | Enter **AllowICMP** or a name of your choosing |
    | **Description** | Leave as Blank or enter a description |

1. Select **Add**.

### Test the Load Balancer’s frontend

1. Return to **Overview** in the virtual machine’s menu and select **Connect**.
1. Sign in to your virtual machine using RDP, SSH, or Bastion.
1. Depending on your VM’s operating system, follow these steps:

### [Windows](#tab/windowsvm/)

1. From your Windows device, open the **Search taskbar** and enter `cmd`. Select **Command Prompt**.
2. In the command prompt, type the following command:

```dos
    ping <Input your load balancer’s public IPv4 address>
```

3. Review ping's output.

### [Linux](#tab/linuxvm/)

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type the following command:

```bash
    ping <Input your load balancer’s public IPv4 address>
```

3. Review ping's output.

## Expected replies with ping

Based on the current health probe state of your backend instances, you receive different replies when testing the Load Balancer’s frontend with ping. Review the following scenarios for the expected reply: 

| **Scenario** | **Expected reply** |
| --- | --- |
| **All backend instances are probed DOWN** | Destination host unreachable  |
| **All backend instances turned OFF** | Unresponsive: Request timed out |
| **At least 1 backend instance is probed UP** | Successful echo replies |
| **No backend instances behind Load Balancer/No load balancing rules associated** | Unresponsive: Request timed out |
