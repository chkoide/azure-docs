# Operational Technology (OT) networks frequently asked questions

This article provides a list of frequently asked questions and answers about OT networks in Defender for IoT.

## Our organization uses proprietary non-standard industrial protocols. Are they supported?

Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive protocol support. In addition to embedded protocol support, you can secure IoT and OT devices running proprietary and custom protocols, or protocols that deviate from any standard. Use the Horizon Open Development Environment (ODE) SDK, to create dissector plugins that decode network traffic based on defined protocols. Traffic is analyzed by services to provide complete monitoring, alerting, and reporting. Use Horizon to:

- Expand visibility and control without the need to upgrade to new versions.
- Secure proprietary information by developing on-site as an external plugin.
- Localize text for alerts, events, and protocol parameters.

This unique solution for developing protocols as plugins, doesn't require dedicated developer teams or version releases in order to support a new protocol. Developers, partners, and customers can securely develop protocols and share insights and knowledge using Horizon.

## Do I have to purchase hardware appliances from Microsoft partners?

Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor runs on specific hardware specs as described in the [Hardware Specifications Guide](./how-to-identify-required-appliances.md), customers can purchase certified hardware from Microsoft partners or use the supplied bill of materials  (BOM) and purchase it on their own.

Certified hardware has been tested in our labs for driver stability, packet drops and network sizing.

## Regulation doesn't allow us to connect our system to the Internet. Can we still utilize Defender for IoT?

Yes you can! The Microsoft Defender for IoT platform on-premises solution is deployed as a physical or virtual sensor appliance that passively ingests network traffic, such as via SPAN, RSPAN, or TAP, to analyze, discover, and continuously monitor IT, OT, and IoT networks. For larger enterprises, multiple sensors can aggregate their data to an on-premises management console.

## Where in the network should I connect monitoring ports?

The Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor connects to a SPAN port or network TAP and immediately begins collecting ICS network traffic via passive (agentless) monitoring. It has zero effect on OT networks since it isn’t placed in the data path and doesn’t actively scan OT devices.

For example:

- A single appliance (virtual of physical) can be in the Shop Floor DMZ layer, having all Shop Floor cell traffic routed to this layer.
- Alternatively, locate small mini-sensors in each Shop Floor cell with either cloud or local management that will reside in the Shop Floor DMZ layer. Another appliance (virtual or physical) can monitor the traffic in the Shop Floor DMZ layer (for SCADA, Historian, or MES).

## How can I change a user's passwords

You can change user passwords or recover access to privileged users on both the OT network sensor and the on-premises management console. For more information, see:

- [Create and manage users on an OT network sensor](manage-users-sensor.md)
- [Create and manage users on an on-premises management console](manage-users-on-premises-management-console.md)

## How do I activate the sensor and on-premises management console

For information on how to activate your on-premises management console, see [Activate and set up an on-premises management console](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-management.md).

## How to change the network configuration

Change network configuration settings before or after you activate your sensor using either of the following options:

- **From the sensor UI**: [Update the OT sensor network configuration](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#update-the-ot-sensor-network-configuration)
- **From the sensor CLI**: [Network configuration](cli-ot-sensor.md#network-configuration)

For more information, see [Activate and set up your OT network sensor](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md), [Getting started with advanced CLI commands](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md), and [CLI command reference from OT network sensors](cli-ot-sensor.md).

## How do I check the sanity of my deployment

After installing the software for your sensor or on-premises management console, you'll want to perform the [Post-installation validation](ot-deploy/post-install-validation-ot-software.md).

You can also use our [UI and CLI tools](how-to-troubleshoot-sensor.md#check-system-health) to check system health and review your overall system statistics.

For more information, see [Troubleshoot the sensor](how-to-troubleshoot-sensor.md) and [Troubleshoot the on-premises management console](how-to-troubleshoot-on-premises-management-console.md).

## I am seeing a warning that we have exceeded the maximum number of devices for the subscription. How do I resolve this?

If the number of actual devices detected by Defender for IoT exceeds the number of committed devices currently listed on your subscription, a warning message will appear in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, and you will need to edit your plan and update the number of committed devices on the relevant subscription. For more information, see [Edit a plan for OT networks](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md#edit-a-plan-for-ot-networks).
