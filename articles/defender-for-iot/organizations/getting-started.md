# Add an OT plan to your Azure subscription

This article describes how to set up a trial plan for OT security monitoring with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

A trial plan for OT monitoring provides 30-day support for 1000 devices. You might want to use this trial with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have:

- An Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can [create your free Azure account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- Access to the Azure portal as a [Security Admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner). For more information, see [Azure user roles for OT and Enterprise IoT monitoring with Defender for IoT](roles-azure.md).

## Add a trial plan

This procedure describes how to add a trial Defender for IoT plan for OT networks to an Azure subscription.

**To add your plan**:

1. In the Azure portal, go to [Defender for IoT](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/~/Getting_started) and select **Plans and pricing** > **Add plan**.

1. In the **Plan settings** pane, define the following settings:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription where you want to add a plan. You'll need a [Security admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) role for the selected subscription.

        > [!TIP]
        > If your subscription isn't listed, check your account details and confirm your permissions with the subscription owner. Also make sure that you have the right subscriptions selected in your Azure settings > **Directories + subscriptions** page.

   - **Price plan**: For the sake of this quickstart, select **Trial - 30 days - 1000 assets limit**.
   
        Microsoft Defender for IoT provides a 30-day free trial for the first 1,000 committed devices for evaluation purposes. Any usage beyond 30 days incurs a charge based on the monthly plan for 1,000 devices. For more information, see [the Microsoft Defender for IoT pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-defender/).
