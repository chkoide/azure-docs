# Transparency Note for Trial Matcher

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it's deployed. Creating a system that is fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to achieve the best performance. 

Microsoft's Transparency Notes are intended to help you understand how our AI technology works, the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment. They are also part of a broader effort at Microsoft to put our AI principles into practice. To find out more, see [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). 

## Example use cases for the Trial Matcher

**Use case** | **Description** 
-------------|----------------

## Considerations when choosing a use case

Given the sensitive nature of health-related data, it's important to consider your use cases carefully. In all cases, a human should be making decisions, assisted by the information the system returns and there should be a way to review the source data and correct errors.

## Don't use
  - **Don't use for scenarios that use this service as a medical device, clinical support, or diagnostic tools to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or other conditions without a human intervention.** A qualified medical professional should always do due diligence and verify the source data regarding patient care decisions.
 - **Don't use for scenarios that use personal health information without appropriate consent.** Health information has special protections that may require explicit consent for certain use. Make sure you have appropriate consent to use health data.
