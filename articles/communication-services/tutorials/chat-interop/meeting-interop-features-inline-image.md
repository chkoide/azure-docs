# Tutorial: Enable inline image support in your Chat app

## Add inline image support
The Chat SDK is designed to work with Microsoft Teams seamlessly. Specifically, Chat SDK provides a solution to receive inline images sent by users from Microsoft Teams. Currently this feature is only available in the Chat SDK for JavaScript. 

The Chat SDK for JavaScript provides `previewUrl` and `url` for each inline image. Please note that some GIF images fetched from `previewUrl` might not be animated and a static preview image would be returned instead. Developers are expected to use the `url` if the intention is to fetch animated images only.
