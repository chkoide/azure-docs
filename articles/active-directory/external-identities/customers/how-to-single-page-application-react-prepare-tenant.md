# Prepare your customer tenant to authenticate users in a React single-page app (SPA)

Before your applications can interact with Microsoft identity platform they must be registered in a customer tenant that you manage and must be associated with a user flow.

In this article, you learn how to register your application and record identifies, create a user flow and associate that user flow with your application.

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F" target="_blank">create a free account</a> before you begin.

This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Azure AD roles include the required permissions:
* Application administrator
* Application developer
* Cloud application administrator

If you haven't already created your own customer tenant, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">create one now</a>. You can use an existing customer tenant if you have one.
