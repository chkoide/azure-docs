## April 2023

### Public Preview - Custom attributes for Azure Active Directory Domain Services

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Azure Active Directory Domain Services                     
**Product capability:** Azure Active Directory Domain Services            

Azure Active Directory Domain Services will now support synchronizing custom attributes from Azure AD for on-premises accounts. For more information, see: [Custom attributes for Azure Active Directory Domain Services](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/concepts-custom-attributes).

### General Availability - Enablement of combined security information registration for MFA and  self-service password reset (SSPR)

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** MFA                     
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection            

Last year we announced the combined registration user experience for MFA and  self-service password reset (SSPR) was rolling out as the default experience for all organizations. We're happy to announce that the combined security information registration experience is now fully rolled out. This change doesn't affect tenants located in the China region. For more information, see: [Combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory overview](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).

---

### General Availability - System preferred MFA method

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                       
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection            

Currently, organizations and users rely on a range of authentication methods, each offering varying degrees of security. While Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is crucial, some MFA methods are more secure than others. Despite having access to more secure MFA options, users frequently choose less secure methods for various reasons.

To address this challenge, we're introducing a new system-preferred authentication method for MFA. When users sign in, the system will determine and display the most secure MFA method that the user has registered. This prompts users to switch from the default method to the most secure option. While users may still choose a different MFA method, they'll always be prompted to use the most secure method first for every session that requires MFA. For more information, see: [System-preferred multifactor authentication - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/concept-system-preferred-multifactor-authentication.md).

---

### General Availability - PIM alert: Alert on active-permanent role assignments in Azure or assignments made outside of PIM

**Type:** Fixed     
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management                     
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management            

[Alert on Azure subscription role assignments made outside of Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](../privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-configure-alerts.md) provides an alert in PIM for Azure subscription assignments made outside of PIM. An owner or User Access Administrator can take a quick remediation action to remove those assignments. 

---

### Public Preview - Enhanced Create User and Invite User Experiences

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** User Management                     
**Product capability:** User Management            

Admins can now define more properties when creating and inviting a user in the Entra admin portal. These improvements bring our UX to parity with our [Create User APIS](/graph/api/user-post-users). Additionally, admins can now add users to a group or administrative unit, and assign roles.  For more information, see: [Add or delete users using Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory.md).

---

### Public Preview - Azure AD Conditional Access protected actions

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** RBAC                    
**Product capability:** Access Control            

The protected actions public preview introduces the ability to apply Conditional Access to select permissions. When a user performs a protected action, they must satisfy Conditional Access policy requirements. For more information, see: [What are protected actions in Azure AD? (preview)](../roles/protected-actions-overview.md).

---

### Public Preview - Token Protection for Sign-in Sessions

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                  
**Product capability:** User Authentication          

Token Protection for sign-in sessions is our first release on a road-map to combat attacks involving token theft and replay. It provides conditional access enforcement of token proof-of-possession for supported clients and services that ensure that access to specified resources is only from a device to which the user has signed in. For more information, see: [Conditional Access: Token protection (preview)](../conditional-access/concept-token-protection.md).

---

### General Availability- New limits on number and size of group secrets starting June 2023

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Group Management                   
**Product capability:** Directory            

Starting in June 2023, the secrets stored on a single group can't exceed 48 individual secrets, or have a total size greater than 10KB across all secrets on a single group. Groups with more than 10KB of secrets will immediately stop working in June 2023. In June, groups exceeding 48 secrets are unable to increase the number of secrets they have, though they may still update or delete those secrets. We highly recommend reducing to fewer than 48 secrets by January 2024.

Group secrets are typically created when a group is assigned credentials to an app using Password-based single sign-on. To reduce the number of secrets assigned to a group, we recommend creating additional groups, and splitting up group assignments to your Password-based SSO applications across those new groups. For more information, see: [Add password-based single sign-on to an application](../manage-apps/configure-password-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications.md).

### Public Preview - Authenticator Lite in Outlook

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication           

Authenticator Lite is an additional surface for AAD users to complete multifactor authentication using push notifications on their Android or iOS device. With Authenticator Lite, users can satisfy a multifactor authentication requirement from the convenience of a familiar app. Authenticator Lite is currently enabled in the Outlook mobile app. Users may receive a notification in their Outlook mobile app to approve or deny, or use the Outlook app to generate an OATH verification code that can be entered during sign-in. The *'Microsoft managed'* setting for this feature will be set to enabled on May 26th, 2023. This will enable the feature for all users in tenants where the feature is set to Microsoft managed. If you wish to change the state of this feature, please do so before May 26th, 2023. For more information, see: [How to enable Microsoft Authenticator Lite for Outlook mobile (preview)](../authentication/how-to-mfa-authenticator-lite.md).

---

### General Availability - Updated look and feel for Per-user MFA

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** MFA                       
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection             

As part of ongoing service improvements, we are making updates to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience to align with the look and feel of Azure. This change does not include any changes to the core functionality and will only include visual improvements.Â  For more information, see: [Enable per-user Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication to secure sign-in events](../authentication/howto-mfa-userstates.md).

---

### General Availability - Additional terms of use audit logs will be turned off

**Type:**  Fixed     
**Service category:** Terms of Use                  
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation          

Due to a technical issue, we have recently started to emit additional audit logs for terms of use. The additional audit logs will be turned off by the first of May and are tagged with the core directory service and the agreement category. If you have built a dependency on the additional audit logs, you must switch to the regular audit logs tagged with the terms of use service.

### General Availability - Number Matching for Microsoft Authenticator notifications

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App                      
**Product capability:** User Authentication             

Microsoft Authenticator appâs number matching feature has been Generally Available since Nov 2022! If you haven't already used the rollout controls (via Azure portal Admin UX and MSGraph APIs) to smoothly deploy number matching for users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications, we highly encourage you to do so. We previously announced that we'll remove the admin controls and enforce the number match experience tenant-wide for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications starting February 27, 2023. After listening to customers, we'll extend the availability of the rollout controls for a few more weeks. Organizations can continue to use the existing rollout controls until May 8, 2023, to deploy number matching in their organizations. Microsoft services will start enforcing the number matching experience for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications after May 8, 2023. We'll also remove the rollout controls for number matching after that date.

If customers donât enable number match for all Microsoft Authenticator push notifications prior to May 8, 2023, Authenticator users may experience inconsistent sign-ins while the services are rolling out this change. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.

For more information, see: [How to use number matching in multifactor authentication (MFA) notifications - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match.md)

### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD

**Type:** Plan for Change     
**Service category:** Identity Protection                     
**Product capability:** Platform             

Earlier, we announced our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), enabling our customers to reach the Azure AD services over IPv4, IPv6 or dual stack endpoints. This is just a reminder that we have started introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach in late March 2023.  
 
If you utilize Conditional Access or Identity Protection, and have IPv6 enabled on any of your devices, you likely must take action to avoid impacting your users. For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to deprioritize IPv4 in any Azure AD features or services. We'll continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this link: [IPv6 support in Azure Active Directory](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support).

### Modernizing Terms of Use Experiences

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Terms of use                  
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation        

Starting July 2023, we're modernizing the following Terms of Use end user experiences with an updated PDF viewer, and moving the experiences from https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com to https://myaccount.microsoft.com:
- View previously accepted terms of use.
- Accept or decline terms of use as part of the sign-in flow.

No functionalities will be removed. The new PDF viewer adds functionality and the limited visual changes in the end-user experiences will be communicated in a future update. If your organization has allow-listed only certain domains, you must ensure your allowlist includes the domains âmyaccount.microsoft.comâ and â*.myaccount.microsoft.comâ for Terms of Use to continue working as expected.

## February 2023

### General Availability - Expanding Privileged Identity Management Role Activation across the Azure portal

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management                    
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management           

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) role activation has been expanded to the Billing and AD extensions in the Azure portal. Shortcuts have been added to Subscriptions (billing) and Access Control (AD) to allow users to activate PIM roles directly from these blades. From the Subscriptions blade, select **View eligible subscriptions** in the horizontal command menu to check your eligible, active, and expired assignments. From there, you can activate an eligible assignment in the same pane. In Access control (IAM) for a resource, you can now select **View my access** to see your currently active and eligible role assignments and activate directly. By integrating PIM capabilities into different Azure portal blades, this new feature allows users to gain temporary access to view or edit subscriptions and resources more easily.


For more information Microsoft cloud settings, see: [Activate my Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles.md).

### General Availability - Follow Azure AD best practices with recommendations

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Reporting                  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting            

Azure AD recommendations help you improve your tenant posture by surfacing opportunities to implement best practices. On a daily basis, Azure AD analyzes the configuration of your tenant. During this analysis, Azure AD compares the data of a recommendation with the actual configuration of your tenant. If a recommendation is flagged as applicable to your tenant, the recommendation appears in the Recommendations section of the Azure AD Overview. 

This release includes our first 3 recommendations:

- Convert from per-user MFA to Conditional Access MFA
- Migration applications from AD FS to Azure AD
- Minimize MFA prompts from known devices


For more information, see: 

- [What are Azure Active Directory recommendations?](../reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations.md)
- [Use the Azure AD recommendations API to implement Azure AD best practices for your tenant](/graph/api/resources/recommendations-api-overview)

### General Availability - More information on why a sign-in was flagged as "unfamiliar"

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Identity Protection                    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection           

Unfamiliar sign-in properties risk detection now provides risk reasons as to which properties are unfamiliar for customers to better investigate that risk. 

Identity Protection now surfaces the unfamiliar properties in the Azure portal on UX and in API as *Additional Info* with a user-friendly description explaining that *the following properties are unfamiliar for this sign-in of the given user*. 

There's no additional work to enable this feature, the unfamiliar properties are shown by default. For more information, see: [Sign-in risk](../identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks.md#sign-in-risk).

### ADAL End of Support Announcement

**Type:** N/A      
**Service category:** Other               
**Product capability:** Developer Experience         

As part of our ongoing initiative to improve the developer experience, service reliability, and security of customer applications, we'll end support for the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL). The final deadline to migrate your applications to Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (MSAL) has been extended to **June 30, 2023**. 

### Why are we doing this?

As we consolidate and evolve the Microsoft Identity platform, we're also investing in making significant improvements to the developer experience and service features that make it possible to build secure, robust and resilient applications. To make these features available to our customers, we needed to update the architecture of our software development kits. As a result of this change, weâve decided that the path forward requires us to sunset Azure Active Directory Authentication Library. This allows us to focus on developer experience investments with Azure Active Directory Authentication Library. 

### What happens?

We recognize that changing libraries isn't an easy task, and can't be accomplished quickly. We're committed to helping customers plan their migrations to Microsoft Authentication Library and execute them with minimal disruption.

- In June 2020, we [announced the 2-year end of support timeline for ADAL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/end-of-support-timelines-for-azure-ad-authentication-library-adal-and-azure-ad-graph/). 
- In December 2022, weâve decided to extend the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library end of support to June 2023. 
- Through the next six months (January 2023 â June 2023) we continue informing customers about the upcoming end of support along with providing guidance on migration. 
- On June 2023 we'll officially sunset Azure Active Directory Authentication Library, removing library documentation and archiving all GitHub repositories related to the project. 

### How to find out which applications in my tenant are using Azure Active Directory Authentication Library?

Refer to our post on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/questions/360928/information-how-to-find-apps-using-adal-in-your-te.html) for details on identifying Azure Active Directory Authentication Library apps with the help of [Azure Workbooks](../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). 
### If Iâm using Azure Active Directory Authentication Library, what can I expect after the deadline? 

- There will be no new releases (security or otherwise) to the library after June 2023. 
- We won't accept any incident reports or support requests for Azure Active Directory Authentication Library. Azure Active Directory Authentication Library to Microsoft Authentication Library migration support would continue.   
- The underpinning services continue working and applications that depend on Azure Active Directory Authentication Library should continue working. Applications, and the resources they access, are at increased security and reliability risk due to not having the latest updates, service configuration, and enhancements made available through the Microsoft Identity platform. 

### What features can I only access with Microsoft Authentication Library?
 
The number of features and capabilities that we're adding to Microsoft Authentication Library libraries are growing weekly. Some of them include: 
- Support for Microsoft accounts (MSA) 
- Support for Azure AD B2C accounts 
- Handling throttling 
- Proactive token refresh and token revocation based on policy or critical events for Microsoft Graph and other APIs that supportâ¯[Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)](../develop/app-resilience-continuous-access-evaluation.md)
- Auth broker support with device-based conditional access policies 
- Azure AD hardware-based certificate authentication (CBA) on mobile  
- System browsers on mobile devices 
And more. For an up-to-date list, refer to our [migration guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal). 

### How to migrate? 

To make the migration process easier, we published a [comprehensive guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal) that documents the migration paths across different platforms and programming languages. 

In addition to the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library to Microsoft Authentication Library update, we recommend migrating from Azure AD Graph API to Microsoft Graph. This change enables you to take advantage of the latest additions and enhancements, such as CAE, across the Microsoft service offering through a single, unified endpoint. You can read more in our [Migrate your apps from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph](/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview) guide. You can post any questions to [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/topics/azure-active-directory.html) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal).

Today, weâre excited to announce our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This allows customers to reach the Azure AD services over both IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols (dual stack).
For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to de-prioritize IPv4 in any Azure Active Directory features or services.
We'll begin introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach, beginning March 31, 2023.
We have guidance that is specifically for Azure AD customers who use IPv6 addresses and also use Named Locations in their Conditional Access policies.

Customers who use named locations to identify specific network boundaries in their organization need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing named locations to anticipate potential risk.
1. Work with your network partner to identify egress IPv6 addresses in use in your environment.
1. Review and update existing named locations to include the identified IPv6 ranges.

Customers who use Conditional Access location based policies to restrict and secure access to their apps from specific networks need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing Conditional Access policies to identify use of named locations as a condition to anticipate potential risk.
1. Review and update existing Conditional Access location based policies to ensure they continue to meet your organizationâs security requirements.
