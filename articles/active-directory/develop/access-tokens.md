# Microsoft identity platform access tokens

Access tokens enable clients to securely call protected web APIs. Web APIs use access tokens to perform authentication and authorization.

Per the OAuth specification, access tokens are opaque strings without a set format. Some identity providers (IDPs) use GUIDs and others use encrypted blobs. The format of the access token can depend on the configuration of the API that accepts it.

Custom APIs registered by developers on the Microsoft identity platform can choose from two different formats of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) called `v1.0` and `v2.0`. Microsoft-developed APIs like Microsoft Graph or APIs in Azure have other proprietary token formats. These proprietary formats that can't be validated might be encrypted tokens, JWTs, or special JWT-like.

The contents of the token are intended only for the API, which means that access tokens must be treated as opaque strings. For validation and debugging purposes *only*, developers can decode JWTs using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms). Tokens that a Microsoft API receives might not always be a JWT that can be decoded.

Clients should use the token response data that's returned with the access token for details on what's inside it. When the client requests an access token, the Microsoft identity platform also returns some metadata about the access token for the consumption of the application. This information includes the expiry time of the access token and the scopes for which it's valid. This data allows the application to do intelligent caching of access tokens without having to parse the access token itself.

See the following sections to learn how an API can validate and use the claims inside an access token.  

> [!NOTE]
> All documentation on this page, except where noted, applies only to tokens issued for registered APIs. It doesn't apply to tokens issued for Microsoft-owned APIs, nor can those tokens be used to validate how the Microsoft identity platform issues tokens for a registered API.  

## Token formats

There are two versions of access tokens available in the Microsoft identity platform: v1.0 and v2.0. These versions determine the claims that are in the token and make sure that a web API can control the contents of the token.

Web APIs have one of the following versions selected as a default during registration:

- v1.0 for Azure AD-only applications. The following example shows a v1.0 token (the keys are changed and personal information is removed, which prevents token validation):

    ```

Set the version for applications by providing the appropriate value to the `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` setting in the [app manifest](reference-app-manifest.md#manifest-reference). The values of `null` and `1` result in v1.0 tokens, and the value of `2` results in v2.0 tokens.

## Token ownership

An access token request involves two parties: the client, who requests the token, and the resource (Web API) that accepts the token. The resource that the token is intended for (its *audience*) is defined in the `aud` claim in a token. Clients use the token but shouldn't understand or attempt to parse it. Resources accept the token.  

The Microsoft identity platform supports issuing any token version from any version endpoint. For example, when the value of `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` is `2`, a client calling the v1.0 endpoint to get a token for that resource receives a v2.0 access token.

Resources always own their tokens using the `aud` claim and are the only applications that can change their token details.

## Claims in access tokens

JWTs contain the following pieces:

- **Header** - Provides information about how to validate the token including information about the type of token and its signing method.
- **Payload** - Contains all of the important data about the user or application that's attempting to call the service.
- **Signature** - Is the raw material used to validate the token.

Each piece is separated by a period (`.`) and separately Base64 encoded.

Claims are present only if a value exists to fill it. An application shouldn't take a dependency on a claim being present. Examples include `pwd_exp` (not every tenant requires passwords to expire) and `family_name` ([client credential](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) flows are on behalf of applications that don't have names). Claims used for access token validation are always present.

The Microsoft identity platform uses some claims to help secure tokens for reuse. The description of `Opaque` marks these claims as not being for public consumption. These claims may or may not appear in a token, and new ones may be added without notice.

### Header claims

| Claim | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `typ` | String - always `JWT` | Indicates that the token is a JWT.|
| `alg` | String | Indicates the algorithm used to sign the token, for example, `RS256`. |
| `kid` | String | Specifies the thumbprint for the public key used for validating the signature of the token. Emitted in both v1.0 and v2.0 access tokens. |
| `x5t` | String | Functions the same (in use and value) as `kid`. `x5t` and is a legacy claim emitted only in v1.0 access tokens for compatibility purposes. |

### Payload claims

| Claim | Format | Description | Authorization considerations |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `aud` | String, an Application ID URI or GUID | Identifies the intended audience of the token. In v2.0 tokens, this value is always the client ID of the API. In v1.0 tokens, it can be the client ID or the resource URI used in the request. The value can depend on how the client requested the token. | This value must be validated, reject the token if the value doesn't match the intended audience. |
| `iss` | String, a security token service (STS) URI | Identifies the STS that constructs and returns the token, and the Azure AD tenant of the authenticated user. If the token issued is a v2.0 token (see the `ver` claim), the URI ends in `/v2.0`. The GUID that indicates that the user is a consumer user from a Microsoft account is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. | The application can use the GUID portion of the claim to restrict the set of tenants that can sign in to the application, if applicable. |
|`idp`| String, usually an STS URI | Records the identity provider that authenticated the subject of the token. This value is identical to the value of the Issuer claim unless the user account isn't in the same tenant as the issuer, such as guests. Use the value of `iss` if the claim isn't present. For personal accounts being used in an organizational context (for instance, a personal account invited to an Azure AD tenant), the `idp` claim may be 'live.com' or an STS URI containing the Microsoft account tenant `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. | |
| `iat` | int, a Unix timestamp | Specifies when the authentication for this token occurred. | |
| `nbf` | int, a Unix timestamp | Specifies the time after which the JWT can be processed. | |
| `exp` | int, a Unix timestamp | Specifies the expiration time before which the JWT can be accepted for processing. A resource may reject the token before this time as well. The rejection can occur for a required change in authentication or when a token is revoked. | |
| `aio` | Opaque String | An internal claim used by Azure AD to record data for token reuse. Resources shouldn't use this claim. | |
| `acr` | String, a `0` or `1`, only present in v1.0 tokens | A value of `0` for the "Authentication context class" claim indicates the end-user authentication didn't meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29115. | |
| `amr` | JSON array of strings, only present in v1.0 tokens | Identifies the authentication method of the subject of the token. | |
| `appid` | String, a GUID, only present in v1.0 tokens | The application ID of the client using the token. The application can act as itself or on behalf of a user. The application ID typically represents an application object, but it can also represent a service principal object in Azure AD. |  `appid` may be used in authorization decisions. |
| `azp` | String, a GUID, only present in v2.0 tokens | A replacement for `appid`. The application ID of the client using the token. The application can act as itself or on behalf of a user. The application ID typically represents an application object, but it can also represent a service principal object in Azure AD. | `azp` may be used in authorization decisions. |
| `appidacr` | String, a `0`, `1`, or `2`, only present in v1.0 tokens | Indicates authentication method of the client. For a public client, the value is `0`. When you use the client ID and client secret, the value is `1`. When you use a client certificate for authentication, the value is `2`. | |
| `azpacr` | String, a `0`, `1`, or `2`, only present in v2.0 tokens | A replacement for `appidacr`. Indicates the authentication method of the client. For a public client, the value is `0`. When you use the client ID and client secret, the value is `1`. When you use a client certificate for authentication, the value is `2`. | |
| `preferred_username` | String, only present in v2.0 tokens. | The primary username that represents the user. The value could be an email address, phone number, or a generic username without a specified format. Use the value for username hints and in human-readable UI as a username. To receive this claim, use the `profile` scope. | Since this value is mutable, don't use it to make authorization decisions. |
| `name` | String | Provides a human-readable value that identifies the subject of the token. The value can vary, it's mutable, and is for display purposes only. To receive this claim, use the `profile` scope. | Don't use this value to make authorization decisions. |
| `scp` | String, a space separated list of scopes | The set of scopes exposed by the application for which the client application has requested (and received) consent. Only included for user tokens. | The application should verify that these scopes are valid ones exposed by the application, and make authorization decisions based on the value of these scopes. |
| `roles` | Array of strings, a list of permissions | The set of permissions exposed by the application that the requesting application or user has been given permission to call.  The [client credential flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) uses this set of permission in place of user scopes for application tokens. For user tokens, this set of values contains the assigned roles of the user on the target application. | These values can be used for managing access, such as enforcing authorization to access a resource. |
| `wids` | Array of [RoleTemplateID](../roles/permissions-reference.md#all-roles) GUIDs | Denotes the tenant-wide roles assigned to this user, from the section of roles present in [Azure AD built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md#all-roles). The `groupMembershipClaims` property of the [application manifest](reference-app-manifest.md) configures this claim on a per-application basis. Set the claim to `All` or `DirectoryRole`. May not be present in tokens obtained through the implicit flow due to token length concerns. | These values can be used for managing access, such as enforcing authorization to access a resource. |
| `groups` | JSON array of GUIDs | Provides object IDs that represent the group memberships of the subject. The `groupMembershipClaims` property of the [application manifest](reference-app-manifest.md) configures the groups claim on a per-application basis. A value of `null` excludes all groups, a value of `SecurityGroup` includes only Active Directory Security Group memberships, and a value of `All` includes both Security Groups and Microsoft 365 Distribution Lists. <br><br>See the `hasgroups` claim for details on using the `groups` claim with the implicit grant. For other flows, if the number of groups the user is in goes over 150 for SAML and 200 for JWT, then Azure AD adds an overage claim to the claim sources. The claim sources point to the Microsoft Graph endpoint that contains the list of groups for the user. | These values can be used for managing access, such as enforcing authorization to access a resource. |
| `hasgroups` | Boolean | If present, always `true`, indicates whether the user is in at least one group. Used in place of the `groups` claim for JWTs in implicit grant flows if the full groups claim would extend the URI fragment beyond the URL length limits (currently six or more groups). Indicates that the client should use the Microsoft Graph API to determine the groups (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userID}/getMemberObjects`) of the user. | |
| `groups:src1` | JSON object | Includes a link to the full groups list for the user when token requests are too large for the token. For JWTs as a distributed claim, for SAML as a new claim in place of the `groups` claim. <br><br>**Example JWT Value**: <br> `"groups":"src1"` <br> `"_claim_sources`: `"src1" : { "endpoint" : "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{userID}/getMemberObjects" }` | |
| `sub` | String | The principal associated with the token. For example, the user of an application. This value is immutable, don't reassign or reuse. The subject is a pairwise identifier that's unique to a particular application ID. If a single user signs into two different applications using two different client IDs, those applications receive two different values for the subject claim. Using the two different values depends on architecture and privacy requirements. See also the `oid` claim, which does remain the same across applications within a tenant. | This value can be used to perform authorization checks, such as when the token is used to access a resource, and can be used as a key in database tables. |
| `oid` | String, a GUID | The immutable identifier for the requestor, which is the verified identity of the user or service principal. This ID uniquely identifies the requestor across applications. Two different applications signing in the same user receive the same value in the `oid` claim. The `oid` can be used when making queries to Microsoft online services, such as the Microsoft Graph. The Microsoft Graph returns this ID as the `id` property for a given user account. Because the `oid` allows multiple applications to correlate principals, to receive this claim for users use the `profile` scope. If a single user exists in multiple tenants, the user contains a different object ID in each tenant. Even though the user logs into each account with the same credentials, the accounts are different. | This value can be used to perform authorization checks, such as when the token is used to access a resource, and can be used as a key in database tables. |
| `tid` | String, a GUID | Represents the tenant that the user is signing in to. For work and school accounts, the GUID is the immutable tenant ID of the organization that the user is signing in to. For sign-ins to the personal Microsoft account tenant (services like Xbox, Teams for Life, or Outlook), the value is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`. To receive this claim, the application must request the `profile` scope. | This value should be considered in combination with other claims in authorization decisions. |
| `unique_name` | String, only present in v1.0 tokens | Provides a human readable value that identifies the subject of the token. | This value can be different within a tenant and use it only for display purposes. |
| `uti` | String | Token identifier claim, equivalent to `jti` in the JWT specification. Unique, per-token identifier that is case-sensitive. | |
| `rh` | Opaque String | An internal claim used by Azure to revalidate tokens. Resources shouldn't use this claim. | |
| `ver` | String, either `1.0` or `2.0` | Indicates the version of the access token. | |

#### Groups overage claim

Azure AD limits the number of object IDs that it includes in the groups claim to stay within the size limit of the HTTP header. If a user is a member of more groups than the overage limit (150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, and only 6 if issued by using the implicit flow), then Azure AD doesn't emit the groups claim in the token. Instead, it includes an overage claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the group membership of the user.

```JSON
{
    ...
    "_claim_names": {
        "groups": "src1"
    },
    "_claim_sources": {
        "src1": {
            "endpoint": "[Url to get this user's group membership from]"
        }   
    }
    ...
}
```

Use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/5-WebApp-AuthZ/5-2-Groups/AppCreationScripts) folder to help test overage scenarios.

#### v1.0 basic claims

The v1.0 tokens include the following claims if applicable, but not v2.0 tokens by default. To use these claims for v2.0, the application requests them using [optional claims](active-directory-optional-claims.md).

| Claim | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `ipaddr`| String | The IP address the user authenticated from. |
| `onprem_sid`| String, in [SID format](/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/sid-components) | In cases where the user has an on-premises authentication, this claim provides their SID. Use this claim for authorization in legacy applications. |
| `pwd_exp`| int, a Unix timestamp | Indicates when the user's password expires. |
| `pwd_url`| String | A URL where users can reset their password. |
| `in_corp`| boolean | Signals if the client is signing in from the corporate network. |
| `nickname`| String | Another name for the user, separate from first or last name.|
| `family_name` | String | Provides the last name, surname, or family name of the user as defined on the user object. |
| `given_name` | String | Provides the first or given name of the user, as set on the user object. |
| `upn` | String | The username of the user. May be a phone number, email address, or unformatted string. Only use for display purposes and providing username hints in reauthentication scenarios. |

#### amr claim

Identities can authenticate in different ways, which may be relevant to the application. The `amr` claim is an array that can contain multiple items, such as `["mfa", "rsa", "pwd"]`, for an authentication that used both a password and the Authenticator app.

| Value | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `pwd` | Password authentication, either a user's Microsoft password or a client secret of an application. |
| `rsa` | Authentication was based on the proof of an RSA key, for example with the [Microsoft Authenticator app](https://aka.ms/AA2kvvu). This value also indicates the use of a self-signed JWT with a service owned X509 certificate in authentication. |
| `otp` | One-time passcode using an email or a text message. |
| `fed` | Indicates the use of a federated authentication assertion (such as JWT or SAML). |
| `wia` | Windows Integrated Authentication |
| `mfa` | Indicates the use of [Multi-factor authentication](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md). Includes the other authentication methods when this claim is present. |
| `ngcmfa` | Equivalent to `mfa`, used for provisioning of certain advanced credential types. |
| `wiaormfa`| The user used Windows or an MFA credential to authenticate. |
| `none` | Indicates no completed authentication. |

## Access token lifetime

The default lifetime of an access token is variable. When issued, the Microsoft identity platform assigns a random value ranging between 60-90 minutes (75 minutes on average) as the default lifetime of an access token. The variation improves service resilience by spreading access token demand over a time, which prevents hourly spikes in traffic to Azure AD.

Tenants that don't use Conditional Access have a default access token lifetime of two hours for clients such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365.

Adjust the lifetime of an access token to control how often the client application expires the application session, and how often it requires the user to reauthenticate (either silently or interactively). To override the default access token lifetime variation, use [Configurable token lifetime (CTL)](configurable-token-lifetimes.md).

Apply default token lifetime variation to organizations that have Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) enabled. Apply default token lifetime variation even if the organizations use CTL policies. The default token lifetime for long lived token lifetime ranges from 20 to 28 hours. When the access token expires, the client must use the refresh token to silently acquire a new refresh token and access token.

Organizations that use [Conditional Access sign-in frequency (SIF)](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md#user-sign-in-frequency) to enforce how frequently sign-ins occur can't override default access token lifetime variation. When organizations use SIF, the time between credential prompts for a client is the token lifetime that ranges from 60 - 90 minutes plus the sign-in frequency interval.  

Here's an example of how default token lifetime variation works with sign-in frequency.  Let's say an organization sets sign-in frequency to occur every hour. When the token has lifetime ranging from 60-90 minutes due to token lifetime variation, the actual sign-in interval occurs anywhere between 1 hour to 2.5 hours.

If a user with a token with a one hour lifetime performs an interactive sign-in at 59 minutes, there's no credential prompt because the sign-in is below the SIF threshold. If a new token has a lifetime of 90 minutes, the user wouldn't see a credential prompt for another hour and a half.  During a silent renewal attempt, Azure AD requires a credential prompt because the total session length has exceeded the sign-in frequency setting of 1 hour. In this example, the time difference between credential prompts due to the SIF interval and token lifetime variation would be 2.5 hours.

## Validate tokens

Not all applications should validate tokens. Only in specific scenarios should applications validate a token:

- Web APIs must validate access tokens sent to them by a client. They must only accept tokens containing their `aud` claim.
- Confidential web applications like ASP.NET Core must validate ID tokens sent to them by using the user's browser in the hybrid flow, before allowing access to a user's data or establishing a session.

If none of the above scenarios apply, there's no need to validate the token, and may present a security and reliability risk when basing decisions on the validity of the token. Public clients like native or single-page applications don't benefit from validating tokens because the application communicates directly with the IDP where SSL protection ensures the tokens are valid.

APIs and web applications must only validate tokens that have an `aud` claim that matches the application. Other resources may have custom token validation rules. For example, you can't validate tokens for Microsoft Graph according to these rules due to their proprietary format. Validating and accepting tokens meant for another resource is an example of the [confused deputy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/441.html) problem.

If the application needs to validate an ID token or an access token, it should first validate the signature of the token and the issuer against the values in the OpenID discovery document. For example, the tenant-independent version of the document is located at [https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration).

The Azure AD middleware has built-in capabilities for validating access tokens, see [samples](sample-v2-code.md) to find one in the appropriate language. There are also several third-party open-source libraries available for JWT validation. For more information about Azure AD authentication libraries and code samples, see the [authentication libraries](reference-v2-libraries.md).

### Validating the signature

A JWT contains three segments separated by the `.` character. The first segment is the **header**, the second is the **body**, and the third is the **signature**. Use the signature segment to evaluate the authenticity of the token.

Azure AD issues tokens signed using the industry standard asymmetric encryption algorithms, such as RS256. The header of the JWT contains information about the key and encryption method used to sign the token:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "x5t": "iBjL1Rcqzhiy4fpxIxdZqohM2Yk",
  "kid": "iBjL1Rcqzhiy4fpxIxdZqohM2Yk"
}
```

The `alg` claim indicates the algorithm used to sign the token, while the `kid` claim indicates the particular public key that was used to validate the token.

At any given point in time, Azure AD may sign an ID token using any one of a certain set of public-private key pairs. Azure AD rotates the possible set of keys on a periodic basis, so write the application to handle those key changes automatically. A reasonable frequency to check for updates to the public keys used by Azure AD is every 24 hours.

Acquire the signing key data necessary to validate the signature by using the [OpenID Connect metadata document](v2-protocols-oidc.md#fetch-the-openid-configuration-document) located at:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

> [!TIP]
> Try this in a browser: [URL](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration)

The following information describes the metadata document:

- Is a JSON object that contains several useful pieces of information, such as the location of the various endpoints required for doing OpenID Connect authentication.
- Includes a `jwks_uri`, which gives the location of the set of public keys that correspond to the private keys used to sign tokens. The JSON Web Key (JWK) located at the `jwks_uri` contains all of the public key information in use at that particular moment in time. [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) describes the JWK format. The application can use the `kid` claim in the JWT header to select the public key, from this document, which corresponds to the private key that has been used to sign a particular token. It can then do signature validation using the correct public key and the indicated algorithm.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `kid` claim to validate the token. Though v1.0 tokens contain both the `x5t` and `kid` claims, v2.0 tokens contain only the `kid` claim.

Doing signature validation is outside the scope of this document. There are many open-source libraries available for helping with signature validation if necessary.  However, the Microsoft identity platform has one token signing extension to the standards, which are custom signing keys.

If the application has custom signing keys as a result of using the [claims-mapping](active-directory-claims-mapping.md) feature, append an `appid` query parameter that contains the application ID. For validation, use `jwks_uri` that points to the signing key information of the application. For example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e` contains a `jwks_uri` of `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/discovery/keys?appid=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e`.

## Token revocation

Refresh tokens are invalidated or revoked at any time, for different reasons. The reasons fall into the categories of timeouts and revocations.

### Token timeouts

Organizations can use [token lifetime configuration](configurable-token-lifetimes.md) to alter the lifetime of refresh tokens Some tokens can go without use. For example, the user doesn't open the application for three months and then the token expires. Applications can encounter scenarios where the login server rejects a refresh token due to its age.

- MaxInactiveTime: Specifies the amount of time that a token can be inactive.
- MaxSessionAge: If MaxAgeSessionMultiFactor or MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor is set to something other than their default (Until-revoked), the user must reauthenticate after the time set in the MaxAgeSession*. Examples:
  - The tenant has a MaxInactiveTime of five days, and the user went on vacation for a week, and so Azure AD hasn't seen a new token request from the user in seven days. The next time the user requests a new token, they'll find their refresh token has been revoked, and they must enter their credentials again.
  - A sensitive application has a MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor of one day. If a user logs in on Monday, and on Tuesday (after 25 hours have elapsed), they must reauthenticate.

### Token revocations

The server possibly revokes refresh tokens due to a change in credentials, or due to use or administrative action. Refresh tokens are in the classes of confidential clients and public clients.

| Change | Password-based cookie | Password-based token | Non-password-based cookie | Non-password-based token | Confidential client token |
|---|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Password expires | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Password changed by user | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User does SSPR | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Admin resets password | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User or admin revokes the refresh tokens by using [PowerShell](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users.actions/invoke-mginvalidateuserrefreshtoken) | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked |
| [Single sign-out](v2-protocols-oidc.md#single-sign-out) on web | Revoked | Stays alive | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive |

#### Non-password-based

A *non-password-based* login is one where the user didn't type in a password to get it. Examples of non-password-based login include:

- Using your face with Windows Hello
- FIDO2 key
- SMS
- Voice
- PIN
