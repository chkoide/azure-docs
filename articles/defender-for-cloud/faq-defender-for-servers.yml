      - question: |
          Can I enable Defender for Servers on a subset of machines in a subscription?
        answer: |
          No. When you enable Microsoft Defender for Servers on an Azure subscription or on a connected AWS account or GCP project, all connected machines are protected by Defender for Servers. Servers that don't have the Log Analytics agent or Azure Monitor agent installed are also protected.

      - question: |
          What servers do I pay for in a subscription?
        answer: |
          When you enable Defender for Servers on a subscription, you're charged for all machines based on their power states.

          **Azure VMs:**

          State | Details | Billing
          --- | --- | ---
          Starting | VM starting up. | Not billed
          Running | Normal working state. | Billed
          Stopping | Transitional. Moves to Stopped state when finished. | Billed
          Stopped | VM shut down from within guest OS or by using PowerOff APIs. Hardware is still allocated, and the machine remains on the host. | Billed
          Deallocating | Transitional. Moves to Deallocated state when finished. | Not billed
          Deallocated | VM stopped and removed from the host. | Not billed 

          **Azure Arc machines:**

          **State** | **Details** | **Billing**
          --- | --- | ---
          Connecting | Servers connected, but heartbeat not yet received. | Not billed
          Connected | Receiving regular heartbeat from Connected Machine agent. | Billed
          Offline/Disconnected | No heartbeat received in 15-30 minutes. | Not billed
          Expired | If disconnected for 45 days, status might change to Expired. | Not billed

  
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable Defender for Servers on the subscription and on the workspace?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers Plan 1 doesn't depend on Log Analytics. When you enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 at the subscription level, Defender for Cloud automatically enables the plan on your default Log Analytics workspaces. If you use a custom workspace, make sure you enable the plan on the workspace. Here's more information:
          
          - If you turn on Defender for Servers for a subscription and for a connected custom workspace, you aren't charged for both. The system identifies unique VMs.
          - If you enable Defender for Servers on cross-subscription workspaces:
            - For the Log Analytics agent, connected machines from all subscriptions are billed, including subscriptions that don't have the Defender for Servers plan enabled.
            - For the Azure Monitor agent, billing and feature coverage for Defender for Servers depends only on the plan being enabled in the subscription.
          
          
      - question: |
          Is the 500 MB of free data ingestion allowance applied per workspace or per machine?
        answer: |
          When you have [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md) enabled, you get 500 MB of free data ingestion per day. The allowance is specifically for the security data types that are directly collected by Defender for Cloud.
          
          This allowance is a daily rate that's averaged across all nodes. Your total daily free limit is equal to \[number of machines\] &times; 500 MB. You aren't charged extra if the total doesn't exceed your total daily free limit, even if some machines send 100 MB and others send 800 MB.

      - question: |
          What data types are included in the daily allowance?
        answer: |
          Defender for Cloud billing is closely tied to the billing for Log Analytics. [Microsoft Defender for Servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) provides an allocation of 500 MB per node per day for machines against the following subset of [security data types](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-category#security):

          - [SecurityAlert](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityalert)
          - [SecurityBaseline](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaseline)
          - [SecurityBaselineSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaselinesummary)
          - [SecurityDetection](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitydetection)
          - [SecurityEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityevent)
          - [WindowsFirewall](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/windowsfirewall)
          - [SysmonEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/sysmonevent)
          - [ProtectionStatus](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/protectionstatus)
          - [Update](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/update) and [UpdateSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/updatesummary) when the Update Management solution isn't running in the workspace or solution targeting is enabled.

          If the workspace is in the legacy per-node pricing tier, the Defender for Cloud and Log Analytics allocations are combined and applied jointly to all billable ingested data.

      - question: |
          Am I charged for machines that don't have Log Analytics installed?
        answer: |
          Yes. You're charged for all machines that are protected by Defender for Servers in Azure subscriptions, connected AWS accounts, or connected GCP projects. The term *machines* includes Azure virtual machines, instances of Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Azure Arc-enabled servers. Machines that don't have Log Analytics installed are covered by protections that don't depend on the Log Analytics agent.

      - question: |
          If an agent reports to multiple workspaces, am I charged twice?
        answer: |
          If a machine reports to multiple workspaces and all of them have Defender for Servers enabled, the machines are billed for each attached workspace.
