## Planned changes

| Planned change | Estimated date for change |
|--|--|
| [Additional scopes added to existing Azure DevOps Connectors](#additional-scopes-added-to-existing-azure-devops-connectors) | May 2023 |
| [Release of containers vulnerability assessment runtime recommendation powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM](#release-of-containers-vulnerability-assessment-runtime-recommendation-powered-by-microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management-mdvm-in-defender-cspm) | June 2023 |
| [Changes to the Defender for DevOps recommendations environment source and resource ID](#changes-to-the-defender-for-devops-recommendations-environment-source-and-resource-id) |  July 2023 |
| [DevOps Resource Deduplication for Defender for DevOps](#devops-resource-deduplication-for-defender-for-devops) | July 2023


### Additional scopes added to existing Azure DevOps Connectors 

**Estimated date for change: May 2023**

Defender for DevOps will be adding more scopes to the already existing Azure DevOps (ADO) application.

The scopes that are set to be added include:

- Advance Security management: `vso.advsec_manage`; Needed to enable, disable and manage, GitHub Advanced Security for ADO. 

- Container Mapping: `vso.extension_manage`, `vso.gallery_manager`; This is needed to share the decorator extension with the ADO organization.  

This change will only affect new Defender for DevOps customers that are trying to onboard ADO resources to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Customers may experience ADO authentication errors when they try to create a new ADO connector. GitHub and existing connector flow will continue to work. This change of scope will result in downtime for any ADO Connector creation experience in May 2023. After May, all new ADO Connectors will be created with new scopes.

### Release of containers vulnerability assessment runtime recommendation powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM

**Estimated date for change: June 2023**

 A new container recommendation in Defender CSPM powered by MDVM is set to be released:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--| 
| Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)â€¯| Container image vulnerability assessment scans container images running on your Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. | c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5

This new recommendation is set to replace the current recommendation of the same name, powered by Qualys, only in Defender CSPM (replacing assessment key 41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c).

### Changes to the Defender for DevOps recommendations environment source and resource ID

**Estimated date for change: June 2023**

The Security DevOps recommendations will be updated to align with the overall Microsoft Defender for Cloud features and experience.  Affected recommendations will point to a new recommendation source environment and have an updated resource ID.


Security DevOps recommendations impacted:
-	Code repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled (preview)

The recommendation environment source will be updated from `Azure` to `AzureDevOps` or `GitHub`. 

The format for resource IDs will be changed from:

`Microsoft.SecurityDevOps/githubConnectors/owners/repos/`

To:

`Microsoft.Security/securityConnectors/devops/azureDevOpsOrgs/projects/repos`
`Microsoft.Security/securityConnectors/devops/gitHubOwners/repos`

As a part of the migration, source code management system specific recommendations will be created for security findings:
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)

Customers that rely on the `resourceID` to query DevOps recommendation data will be affected. For example, Azure Resource Graph queries, workbooks queries, API calls to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

Queries will need to be updated to include both the old and new `resourceID` to show both, for example, total over time.  

The recommendations page's experience will have minimal impact and deprecated assessments may continue to show for a maximum of 14 days if new scan results are not submitted.  

### DevOps Resource Deduplication for Defender for DevOps

**Estimated date for change: July 2023**

To improve the Defender for DevOps user experience and enable further integration with Defender for Cloud's rich set of capabilities, Defender for DevOps will no longer support duplicate instances of a DevOps organization to be onboarded to an Azure tenant. 

If you don't have an instance of a DevOps organization onboarded more than once to your organization, no further action is required. If you do have more than one instance of a DevOps organization onboarded to your tenant, the subscription owner will be notified and will need to delete the DevOps Connector(s) they don't want to keep by navigating to Defender for Cloud Environment Settings. 

Customers will have until July 31, 2023 to resolve this issue. After this date, only the most recent DevOps Connector created where an instance of the DevOps organization exists will remain onboarded to Defender for DevOps. For example, if Organization Contoso exists in both connectorA and connectorB, and connectorB was created after connectorA, then connectorA will be removed from Defender for DevOps.
