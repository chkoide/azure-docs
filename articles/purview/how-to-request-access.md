# How to request access for a data asset

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

If you discover a data asset in the catalog that you would like to access, you can request access directly through Microsoft Purview. The request will trigger a workflow that will request that the owners of the data resource grant you access to that data source.

This article outlines how to make an access request.

> [!NOTE]
> For this option to be available for a resource, a [self-service access workflow](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md) needs to be created and assigned to the collection where the resource is registered. Contact the collection administrator, data source administrator, or workflow administrator of your collection for more information.
> Or, for information on how to create a self-service access workflow, see our [self-service access workflow documentation](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md).
